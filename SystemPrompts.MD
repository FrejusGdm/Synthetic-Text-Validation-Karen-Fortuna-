# ChatGPT API Prompts for Data Generation

## Project Overview

This study investigates the potential of using synthetic text to augment training data for Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, specifically within the context of peer support tools. We used ChatGPT to generate transcript-like text to validate if AI-generated sentences could be used to train our recommendation algorithm for peer supporters.

## System Prompts

We used two system prompts in our study. Here they are:

### Prompt 1
