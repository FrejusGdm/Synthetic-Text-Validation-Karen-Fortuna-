# Synthetic Text Generation for Peer Support NLP Models

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for our study on using synthetic text to augment training data for Natural Language Processing (NLP) models in the context of peer support tools. We investigated the potential of using ChatGPT to generate transcript-like text for training recommendation algorithms for peer supporters.

## Conference Acceptance

This work has been accepted for presentation at the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB) 2025. The full paper will be available after the conference.
